To become a member, all players pay a fee to the club. This pays for shuttles, coaches, courts, transport to matches and more. The fees correspond to what you get in return as a member of one of our 3 squads: Performance, Development or Social. If you wish to join the "Performance" or "Development" squads you should attend trials at the start of the year and a committee member will discuss with you which membership is most appropriate for you.

#### Performance Membership:
This is for strong and committed players wanting to compete for the University and recieve lots of training time. Membership includes:

All memberships also require students to hold an [SEH Access Pass](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sport/memberships/student/). The [SEH Access Pass](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sport/memberships/student/) requires a one-off payment of £25 which goes directly to SEH (the sports facilities provider), not the badminton club, and will permit you access to the sports facilities. This single payment of £25 is made via the Bristol SU website when joining any sports club. Please note: you only need to buy the [SEH Access Pass](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sport/memberships/student/) ONCE, even if you join multiple sports clubs. For more information, click this link: [SEH Access Pass](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sport/memberships/student/), scroll down to "Helpful information & Troubleshooting" and read the section titled "Sports Clubs".
