To become a member all players pay a fee to the club; this pays for shuttles, coaches, transport to matches and more. The memberships available are linked to our 3 squads; Performance, Development and Social. After attending a trial session, a committee member will discuss with you which membership is most appropriate for you.

- Performance memberships are available for those looking to play in our BUCS teams and compete for the University.
- Development memberships are available to strong players wanting to play in Local League teams, those who are improving towards the performance standard or would prefer a lower training commitment compared to the performance squad.
- Social memberships are available to anyone who would like to become a member of the club, whether you have never picked up a racket or just want an opportunity to play regularly.

All memberships require students to hold at least a [#WeAreBristol membership for the University Sports Centre](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sport/memberships/student/).

Check out the membership tariffs below: For those who are only around for half of the academic year, we offer half year memberships, which are £47.50 for Performance Players, £40 for Development Players and £27.50 for Social Players. If you would like to play Disability Badminton, we charge £1 per session, but you will still need to register with us on the Bristol SU website.
