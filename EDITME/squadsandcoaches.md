# Performance Squad and BUCS teams

The performance squad is made up of around 30 players who train 4 times per week and compete for spots within the 3 Men’s and 2 Ladies’ BUCS teams, as well 2 teams that compete in a singles league around Bristol. The players selected into this squad receive professional coaching from our two coaches at least once per week.

Our social section is open to everyone and is a great way to get involved with badminton. Friendly matches and games are played throughout this session and are put on according to standard so no need to worry if you have never picked up a racket before or have played for many years, you won't be alone! Social members will also receive access to badminton clinic sessions run by student coaches to improve technical ability and shot quality - an excellent opportunity for players looking to improve their badminton.
