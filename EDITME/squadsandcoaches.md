# Development Squad

The Development squad is made up of 40 players and offers a competitive string of badminton for students with less time commitment than the performance squad. Players from this section form three local league teams ([Men's, Women's and Mixed teams in Bristol Leagues](http://www.avonba.co.uk/)) and an opportunity to play in the Time Attack competition run at the National BUCS event annually. Players in this section can move up to the performance squad and into the BUCS teams.

# Social Section

Our social section is open to everyone and is a great way to get involved with badminton. Friendly matches and games are played throughout this session and are put on according to standard so no need to worry if you have never picked up a racket before or have played for many years, you won't be alone! Social members will also receive access to badminton clinic sessions run by student coaches to improve technical ability and shot quality - an excellent opportunity for players looking to improve their badminton.
