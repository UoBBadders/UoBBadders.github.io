UoBBC is a large, thriving and vibrant club within Bristol Sport. Our club mission is to provide all of our members the opportunity to play competitive and recreational badminton in an open and friendly environment. We encourage students of any ability to get in contact and come play! We offer a range of sessions with the aim of providing a fun way to develop or compete in badminton.

Currently the club has over 150 members, 2 professional coaches and a range of student volunteer coaches. This enables the club to support players at the beginning of their badminton career all the way through to those competing internationally.

The club uses a 3-tiered system, providing a *social section*, *development squad* and *performance squad* to cater to all abilities.

The club has strong links with the county team and local badminton community, with 3 members playing for various Avon squads. 

We support the Stonewall Rainbow laces campaign to make sport everyone’s game. This campaign raises issues in sport for LGBT+ fans, players and officials. For more info please check out the Stonewall website: http://www.stonewall.org.uk/our-work/campaigns/rainbow-laces 

The University of Bristol Badminton Club welcomes ALL Bristol students and are committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment at all times.
The University of Bristol Badminton Club will take a stance against discrimination in all its forms, therefore making activities at the club fun and open for all.
We recently conducted a survey of our members to see how well we were performing in these areas, and where we can improve in the future. This has led to the creation of our Equality and Diversity One Year Plan, which can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tqZuRvvsvlusrYmSJLYYCiwdZtQ3hO27we4PEEyakXs/edit?usp=sharingl 

Sustainability is one of UoBBC’s core values. We are committed to reducing our social, economic and environmental impact both locally and globally. We also recognise that the club will exist for a long time after all our current members have moved on, and so leaving a sustainable club for future members means people can continue to enjoy the sport for many years to come.

It doesn’t stop there! Off-court the opportunities and community atmosphere continues. With socials ranging from big nights out, trampolining, awards nights and spectating professional badminton, true friendships can be and are made within the club.
