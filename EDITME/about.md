UoBBC is a large, thriving and vibrant club within Bristol Sport. Our club mission is to provide all of our members the opportunity to play competitive and recreational badminton in an open and friendly environment. We encourage students of any ability to get in contact and come play! We offer a range of sessions with the aim of providing a fun way to develop or compete in badminton. 

Currently the club has over 200 members, 2 professional coaches and a range of student volunteer coaches. This enables the club to support players at the beginning of their badminton career all the way through to those competing internationally. The club has 3 squads and offers disability badminton. The use of a 3-tiered system plus disability badminton, providing a social section, development squad and performance squad, allows us to cater for all abilities. The club has strong links with the county team and local badminton community, with 3 members playing for various Avon squads. 

It doesn’t stop there! Off-court the opportunities and community atmosphere continues. We host a yearly Winter and Summer Club Formal where all the stops are pulled out to look nice and fancy, but also with more casual socials ranging from big nights out, a family scheme league, laser tag, awards nights and spectating professional badminton. We even cover ourselves with glow-in-the-dark paint just for a solid 10-hour overnight UV badminton session as a chance to raise money for Ign10tion!  

True friendships can be and are made within the club.
