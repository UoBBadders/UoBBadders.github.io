University of Bristol Badminton Club is a large, thriving and vibrant club within Bristol Sport. The club has achieved the Student Union's Gold Balloon Accreditation every year for the past 5 years, testament to the quality of the club and its members. We were awarded Sports Club of the Year for the 2021/2022 academic year. Our club mission is to provide all of our members with the regular opportunity to play competitive and recreational badminton in an open and friendly environment. With a range of squads and sessions, we encourage students of any ability to get involved, come along and play!

With typically around 250 members, we are one of the biggest indoor sports club at the University of Bristol. Our 3-tiered system of "Social", "Development" and "Performance" squads, plus disability badminton, caters for all levels of ability and committment and enables us to support players at the beginning of their badminton career all the way through to those competing internationally. High level athletes can apply for the University's [Vice-Chancellor's Scholarship](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/finances/scholarships/vc-scholarship/terms/) whilst dedicated "Performance" members wanting additional support can apply for a [Badminton Maroon Scholarship](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sport/performance/squad/maroon-athletes/) to recieve 1-to-1 coaching, nutrition and psychology training, discounts and much more! The club has strong links with the local and national badminton community: we take part in local league competitions; we host and run tournaments on the national [Badminton England Circuit](https://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/on-court/competition/) (in which our students compete); and some of our members play for various Avon county squads. We also have 5 teams competing in BUCS: 3 Men's and 2 Women's teams. W1 compete in the Premier division of their league, while M1 play in the Men's Tier 1 for the West of England. W2 compete in Western 1A and M2 compete in Western 2B. M3 performed stunningly last season, topping Western 3A, and will be rewarded with a promotion to Western Tier 2 next season. 

It doesnâ€™t stop there! As a member of the club, you will be part of a friendly community and get to experience a variety of events and socials. We host yearly Winter and Summer Club Formals where all the stops are pulled out with regards to quality and luxury; a subsidised trip to the All England Badminton Championships in Birmingham; an awards night; a family scheme league; Racket Wars competition against tennis, squash and table tennis; and plenty of big nights out. We even cover ourselves with glow-in-the-dark paint for a solid 10-hour overnight UV badminton session to raise money for Ignit10n!
