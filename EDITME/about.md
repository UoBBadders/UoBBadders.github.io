University of Bristol Badminton Club is a large, thriving and vibrant club within Bristol Sport. Our club mission is to provide all of our members the regular opportunity to play competitive and recreational badminton in an open and friendly environment. With a range of squads and sessions, we encourage students of any ability to get in contact and come play!

Currently the club has over 270 members, 2 professional coaches and a range of student volunteer coaches. This makes us the largest indoor sports club at the university, and our 3-tiered system plus disability badminton enables us to support players at the beginning of their badminton career all the way through to those competing internationally. The club has strong links with the county team and local badminton community, with 3 members playing for various Avon squads. We have 5 teams competing in BUCS: 3 Mens and 2 Womens teams. Both M1 and W1 compete in the Premier divisions of their respective leagues, whilst W2 compete in Western 1A and M2 and M3 compete in Western 2B and 3A respectively.

It doesnâ€™t stop there! Off-court the opportunities and community atmosphere continues. We host a yearly Winter and Summer Club Formal where all the stops are pulled out to look nice and fancy, but also with more casual socials ranging from big nights out, a family scheme league, laser tag, awards nights and spectating professional badminton. We even cover ourselves with glow-in-the-dark paint for a solid 10-hour overnight UV badminton session as a chance to raise money for Ignit10n!
