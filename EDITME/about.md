**Covid-19 Update:**
*This is a challenging time for every sports club, and we are no different. We have been lucky enough to be able to resume play earlier than a lot of sports, and so we hope to run our season almost as we usually would - albeit with some changes. We are closely following Badminton England's [Return to Play guidelines](https://www.badmintonengland.co.uk/return-to-play/) which place limits on the number of people allowed per court and the coach-to-player ratio, as well as providing guidance on enforcing social distancing within the sports hall. A designated Covid-19 officer is present at every session we run to ensure these rules are adhered to. 
BUCS matches will not start until January this year, but we will be training nonetheless and can't wait to see you all back on court!* 

University of Bristol Badminton Club is a large, thriving and vibrant club within Bristol Sport. Our club mission is to provide all of our members the opportunity to play competitive and recreational badminton in an open and friendly environment. We encourage students of any ability to get in contact and come play! We offer a range of sessions with the aim of providing a fun way to develop or compete in badminton. 

Currently the club has over 270 members, 2 professional coaches and a range of student volunteer coaches. This makes us the largest indoor sports club at the university, and our 3-tiered system plus disability badminton enables us to support players at the beginning of their badminton career all the way through to those competing internationally. The club has strong links with the county team and local badminton community, with 3 members playing for various Avon squads. 

It doesnâ€™t stop there! Off-court the opportunities and community atmosphere continues. We host a yearly Winter and Summer Club Formal where all the stops are pulled out to look nice and fancy, but also with more casual socials ranging from big nights out, a family scheme league, laser tag, awards nights and spectating professional badminton. We even cover ourselves with glow-in-the-dark paint just for a solid 10-hour overnight UV badminton session as a chance to raise money for Ign10tion!  

True friendships can be and are made within the club.
