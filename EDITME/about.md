University of Bristol Badminton Club is a large, thriving and vibrant club within Bristol Sport. Our club mission is to provide all of our members with the regular opportunity to play competitive and recreational badminton in an open and friendly environment. With a range of squads and sessions, we encourage students of any ability to get in contact and come play!

With typically around 250 members, we are the largest indoor sports club at the University of Bristol. Our 3-tiered system of "Social", "Development" and "Performance" squads, plus disability badminton, caters for people of all levels of ability and committment and enables us to support players at the beginning of their badminton career all the way through to those competing internationally. Dedicated "Performance" members wanting additional support can apply for a Badminton Maroon Scholarship to recieve 1-to-1 coaching, nutrition and psychology training, discounts and much more! The club has strong links with the county team and local badminton community, taking part in local league competitions with 3 members playing for various Avon squads. We also have 5 teams competing in BUCS: 3 Mens and 2 Womens teams. Both M1 and W1 compete in the Premier divisions of their respective leagues, whilst W2 compete in Western 1A and M2 and M3 compete in Western 2B and 3A respectively.

It doesnâ€™t stop there! As a member of the club, you will be part of a friendly community and get to experience a variety of events and socials. We host yearly Winter and Summer Club Formals where all the stops are pulled out to look nice and fancy; a trip to the All England Badminton Championships; awards night; a family scheme league; Racket Wars competition against tennis, squash and table tennis; and plenty of big nights out. We even cover ourselves with glow-in-the-dark paint for a solid 10-hour overnight UV badminton session to raise money for Ignit10n!
