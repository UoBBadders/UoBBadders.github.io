UoBBC is a large, thriving and vibrant club within Bristol Sport. Our club mission is to provide all of our members the opportunity to play competitive and recreational badminton in an open and friendly environment. We encourages students of any ability who want to give badminton a go to get in contact and come play in a range of sessions we offer with the aim of providing a fun way to develop or compete in badminton.
<br><br>
Currently the club has over 130 members, two professional coaches and a range of student volunteer coaches. This enables the club to support players at the beginning of their badminton career all the way through to those competing internationally.
<br><br>
The club uses a 3-tiered system, providing a social section, development squad and performance squad to cater to all abilities.
<br><br>
The social tier provides and active and enthusiastic platform for beginners and recreational players often seeing 50 active members at each session. In addition, this section gains experience from more focussed individual or group badminton clinic sessions run by our student coaches.
<br><br>
The development squad, a more competitive outlet with student-led court time and group coaching, provides three local league teams including Men’s, Women’s and Mixed teams. Development players also had success winning the National Time Attack Competition at BUCS (British University and College Sport) competition in February 2016.
<br><br>
Our performance squad attracts competitive club, county and international players to compete against the UKs best universities in BUCS league, cup and individual competition. The club has also seen great successes here with promotion of Women’s 1st in to the Premier Division. Men’s 1st & 2nd achieving 2nd place in division 1A and 2A respectively.
<br><br>
The club has strong links with the county team and local badminton community, with 3 members playing for various Avon squads and a thriving scene of competition and professional badminton UoBBC provides a great way to get involved during university life.
And it doesn’t stop there, off-court the opportunities and community atmosphere continues. With socials ranging from trampolining to nights out, awards night to spectating professional badminton, true friendships can be and are made within the club.
