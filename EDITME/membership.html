To become a member all players pay a fee to the club; this pays for shuttles, coaches, transport to matches and more. The memberships available are linked to our 3 squads; performance, development and social. After attending a trial session, a committee member will discuss with you which membership is most appropriate for you.
<br><br>
Performance memberships are available for those looking to play in our BUCS teams and compete for the University.
<br>
Development memberships are available to strong players wanting to play in Local League teams, those who are improving towards the performance standard or would prefer a lower training commitment compared to the performance squad.
<br>
Social memberships are available to anyone who would like to become a member of the club, whether you have never picked up a racket or just want an opportunity to play regularly.
<br><br>
All memberships require students to hold at least a <a class="link" href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/sport/memberships/student/" target="_blank">Get Active SEH membership for the University Sports Centre.</a>
